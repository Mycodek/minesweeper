## Minesweeper — A Game of Logic, Not Luck

Play here: **[https://mycodek.github.io/minesweeper/](https://mycodek.github.io/minesweeper/)**

This is not about randomly clicking tiles and hoping for the best.

Every cell tells a story.
Every number is a constraint.
Every move is a deduction.

Win because you *reasoned correctly*, not because you got lucky.

### What this version is about

Most people treat Minesweeper like a guessing game. It isn’t.

At its core, Minesweeper is:

* Constraint solving
* Pattern recognition
* Risk evaluation under uncertainty

Each revealed number defines the state of the unknown around it.
The board is a living system of dependencies.

If you pay attention, the grid becomes predictable.

If you don’t, you explode.

### Why play this?

Because it forces:

* disciplined thinking
* probabilistic judgement
* decision-making with incomplete information

You’re not clearing mines.

You’re interpreting signals.

### The Rule That Matters

A cell doesn’t care what you *want* it to be.

It only reflects what is *logically possible*.

Understand that — and the board opens up.

Ignore it — and you’re guessing.
